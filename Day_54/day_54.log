#Day_54_of_150_days_challange
Configured server-02 to mirror server-01 using Bash script I developed during my web server project. Automation is key! Also set up HAproxy to distribute traffic between server-0111 and server-02 using a round-robin algorithm. Managed HAproxy via an init script. Servers configured with correct hostnames. #CodingChallenge
