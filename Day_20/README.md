# Explanation:
- The function takes two parameters: `board`  representing the tic-tac-toe board and `sgn` ``the symbol 'X' or 'O' that represents the player``.
- It checks the value of `sgn` to determine whether it's looking for a victory condition for 'X' or 'O'.
- If `sgn` is 'X', it sets `who` to 'me', indicating that it's the computer's side. If `sgn` is 'O', it sets `who` to 'you', indicating it's the player's side. If `sgn` is neither 'X' nor 'O', it sets `who` to `None`.
- It initializes two boolean variables `cross1` and `cross2` to `True`. These variables will be used to track the state of the two diagonals.
- The function then iterates over the rows and columns of the `board` using the variable `rc`.
- It checks if any row `rc` contains three consecutive symbols equal to `sgn`. If it does, it returns the value of `who`.
- Similarly, it checks if any column `rc` contains three consecutive symbols equal to `sgn`. If it does, it returns the value of `who`.
- It also checks the diagonals. If any symbol in the first diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) is not equal to `sgn`, it sets `cross1` to `False`. Similarly, if any symbol in the second diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is not equal to `sgn`, it sets `cross2` to `False`.
- Finally, if either `cross1` or `cross2` is `True`, it returns the value of `who`. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
